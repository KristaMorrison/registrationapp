This registration app was built as part of my eductation at LEARN academy.  It was completed as a pair programming project with Amir Nazemian and Jon Richardson.

The challenge was to create an app where a user could register with their personal info, log in with a username and password, and successfully log out of the app.  This app was also built with rspec testing to ensure it's functionality.  Some key components of the app include:
- The user must register with valid credentials, which are stored in a user database
- The user may not register with a username already taken
- The user may enter up to three phone numbers, which are stored in a separate table referencing the users table
- The user must enter the correct username and password to successfully log into the app
- When the user is logged out, the session is deleted, thereby preventing the use of stored information by a third party
